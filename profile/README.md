Welcome to the **Global Governance Observatory**.
The aim of the GGO is to support more comparative studies of global governance,
by making available a repository of data on global governance from various domains.

Tools to download and work with the data are available in R via [manydata](https://github.com/globalgov/manydata).
This package is in turn supported by [manypkgs](https://github.com/globalgov/manypkgs), for creating and extending manydata packages,
and [messydates](https://github.com/globalgov/messydates), for working with a more flexible class of dates in R.

Many 'manydata' packages are available through the manydata package:
- [manystates](https://github.com/globalgov/manystates)
- [manytreaties](https://github.com/globalgov/manytreaties)
- [manyios](https://github.com/globalgov/manyios)

Development has been funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [Grant Number 188976](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976): “Power and Networks and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes” (PANARCHIC).
See [panarchic.ch](https://panarchic.ch/) for more about the project.
